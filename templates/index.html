        <h2 class="section-title">What can I use website for?</h2>
        <a class="section-text">
            This website was created for social networks like WhatsApp or Discord, where you can't directly create a poll(like in Telegram) and send it to your friends.
            But you can use this website, create poll, copy link and after some time view results of the poll.

        <h2 class="section-title">Technical task</h2>
        <a class="section-text">
            Create website that will provide simple polls creation with local database, pretty design and simple architecture that everyone will understand.<br>
            There will be some pages:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Main page that show information about website.</li>
                <li>Account creation page.</li>
                <li>Account page that shows some info to user and let log out account.</li>
                <li>Poll page itself that will show poll options to users who didn't vote and results of poll to users who voted already.</li>
            </ul>
            Beautiful design will be provided mostly with JS with canvas element that will create beautiful particles 
            effect, some modern CSS styles(with glowing and opacity) and also with some simple features like fonts.<br>
